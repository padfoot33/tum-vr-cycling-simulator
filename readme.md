```

## Manual installation



### Repo Setup

Make sure to have the ssh key of this machine your are working on added to your account.

Use Git Bash for the setup of the repo, otherwise vcs tools will not work

install vcs tools:
```
pip install vcstool2
```

IMPORTANT: Check for warnings regarding the PATH variable. 

get submodules
```
vcs import < assets.repos

```

download the 3d model:
```
wget "https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-gis/tum2twin-datasets/-/raw/0ec6f8d87cfe58ac03bdae2c690632c08fd3d625/fbx/tum_main_campus.fbx" -OutFile "Assets/3d_model/tum_main_campus.fbx"
```



### Sumo Python Envrionment Setup

The prompts in this guide refer to git bash and not "powershell" or "cmd"

Go to The Sumo Folder where the python script for "TraCI" is located:

Setup the envrionment
```
cd Assets/Sumonity/SumoTraCI
```

Install the virtualenvironment toolset
```
pip install virtualenv 
```

Enable execution of scripts, open powershell in admin mode:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```


Activate it and install dependencies:
```
python3.11 -m venv venv
.\venv\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Note: 
- Use Python 3.11, otherwise you will run into compatability issues.


## Running the Simulation

Open the project in Unity and run `Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity`.

## Troubleshooting

### VCS Tool and Win11
If you have to work with Windows 11, install vcstool2 in a python venv!
